This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `calc()` function in CSS. The `bug.css` file shows the incorrect usage that leads to unexpected results, while `bugSolution.css` provides the correct implementation.  The issue arises from the order of operations in `calc()` when using percentages and the requirement for specifying units for all values within the calculation.  The README.md provides details on how to reproduce and fix the error.
