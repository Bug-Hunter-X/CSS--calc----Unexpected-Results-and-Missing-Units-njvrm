To solve the issue, always ensure that units are specified for all values in a `calc()` expression and be mindful of the order of operations.  Consider using parentheses to explicitly control the order of calculation to avoid ambiguity.

Example of Correct Usage:

```css
width: calc((50% - 10px) / 2);
height: calc(100% - 20px);
```

In this example, parentheses ensure that 10px is subtracted from 50% before the result is divided by 2. Units (px) are included for all pixel values.  Also, ensure that the parent container has defined dimensions for percentage calculations to function correctly.
